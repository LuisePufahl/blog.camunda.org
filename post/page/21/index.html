      </header>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>Throughout development of Camunda 7.4, one of our focus points is job executor features and improvements. The job executor is the process engine's component to perform deferred actions, such as executing an intermediate timer event or an asynchronous continuation. Thus it is central in the Camunda architecture and central for scaling the BPM platform in a cluster. In this post we provide insight in job executor behavior and how job executor instances be coordinated by employing a backoff strategy that is part of the upcoming Camunad 7.4.0-alpha2 release.</div>

For two days somewhere in Brandenburg we were "Awesome-Team-Awesome" and we turned the Camunda engine into a platform to create a D&amp;D style quest game. We call it BPMN Quest.

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>Last week we had our anual hack days - that means 48 hours of producing something aswesome. Together with Falko, Ingo and Thorben we build a context help within the Camunda BPM Workbench protoype. This uses Apache SOLR&nbsp;to index various sources (we did the user forum, the docs on Github, a Community Extension and internal best practices). We discussed details on this index and did a comparison to ElasticSearch. It was a great study for options and use cases of such a help in our tool chain - but watch the result yourself: Context Help / Search via SOLR - hooken into Camunda BPM Workbench from camunda on Vimeo.</div>

        <div>As part of the Hack Days this year my colleague Falko migrated an existing tool we (Camunda Consulting) used with success in a lot of projects to&nbsp;bpmn.io: The Process Test Coverage Report Generator. It just hooks into an automated test (typically JUnit) and creates an HTML report showing the coverage: For every Test Case For the whole Test Suite See this example for one test case - obviously the Happy Path of the process model: The report can easily be watched locally within your IDE or hooked into your Jenkins Build.</div>

        <div>We have some good news: We implemented the repetition rule in our CMMN engine. This gives the users the ability to repeat a task under certain conditions. We invite you to try it out! For testing purposes use the current 7.4.0-SNAPSHOT of the engine and repeat a CMMN task as often as you wish. There also exists some documentation with an explanation how the repetition rule works and how you can use it.</div>

        <div>If you've ever been lucky enough to enjoy Camunda's BPMN training then you probably have fond memories of the slide featuring Compensation tasks and Cancel events. It happens to be the very last slide in the symbol set section and is traditionally follows by a well deserved break. It also happens to be a very well implemented part of the Camunda engine. This post is going to be all about how a process containing a transaction, cancel end event and compensation task are all implemented.</div>

        <div>If you’ve already downloaded the Camunda BPM platform you’ve already got our invoice example running locally. So I’m going to start with how you might run through that process using our REST API. I’m going to assume that you’ve got some method of making those calls either programmatically or using a RestClient (I’ve used chrome’s advanced rest client&nbsp;to test the calls). So lets begin...&nbsp; Starting the process.&nbsp; For most processes we could kick things off by using the start process instance rest call /process-definition/key/{key}/start.&nbsp;But because the invoice process has a start form I’m going to use another way of starting the process /process-definition/key/{key}/submit-form [2].</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>Camunda users process heavy workloads with the process engine. Often this includes asynchronous processing which is handled using the job executor component. The amount of jobs that need to be processed can quickly reach an order of magnitude of millions of jobs per day. To bring order into situations of high job executor load, Camunda BPM 7.4.0 will ship job prioritization. With our first 7.4.0-alpha1 release, you can already have a look at it and give it a try.</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>We get this question very often from customers: How can we get rid of old history data that we don't need anymore?&nbsp;First it's important to ask: "What do you mean by 'old data'?". This is completely business focused and depends on the use of cockpit, who is working with the history data, how reports are generated and maybe even constraints due to legislation. One of our customers - Hamburger Sparkasse (Haspa) - built a solution that is flexible enough to address the issues raised by the questions above: They created a bunch of SQL scripts Created a parameter&nbsp;for&nbsp;the number of days that completed process instances should remain in the database which then&nbsp;moved the old data into a set of archive tables and marked them with the time-stamp and a sequence number of the cleanup run.</div>

Until now... In this post I'm going to explain in detail how you can deploy Camunda BPM to a server using docker and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and interestingly enough - it doesn't require so much as a glance at a console cursor.</div>

From the engine's early beginnings, its multi-instance implementation was more of a quick hack than a durable solution. Yet, it was carried from release to release, the pile of bugs and hair lost by desperate developers growing steadily. With Camunda BPM 7.3, we have refactored multi-instance fundamentally, drying one of the largest bug sources and fighting developer bald-headedness.</div>

In this post I show how the Camunda Spin can be used for implementing data transformations and mapping in combination with the Java 8 Stream processing API and contrast this to the classical Java 6 / 7 way of doing it.</div>

        <div>Cancelling a running process instance in Camunda is easy: DELETE /process-instance/{id} or, using Java API: RuntimeService.deleteProcessInstance(String, String) this will simply delete the process instance and remove it from the database. Sometimes this is exactly what you need. However: what if you want to cancel the process instance gracefully? Gracefully in the sense that the effects it has had on the outside world are undone? The answer to this is compensation. In this post I discuss two ways to implement compensation.</div>

        <div>With Camunda BPM 7.2, we have released our very first implementation of the Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) standard. Some people even say it is the first available CMMN implementation at all. Like BPMN, CMMN is a specification by the Object Management Group and while BPMN is a standard for modeling processes that are highly structured, CMMN is a standard for modeling cases. In contrast to processes, cases are user- and data-driven and typically are much less pre-defined in terms of execution order and required tasks.</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>In an international open source project like ours, the users speak a huge variety of languages. When building our new Tasklist we had to adress the question of how to deal with internationalization. Customizing Your Own Language In addition to the default language, we added the possibility to plugin your own language for all Tasklist texts, labels, dates and date formats. You can of course use multiple languages at a time, based on the browser settings of your users.</div>

        <div>The last days before I traveled to Hong Kong I built a cockpit plugin to show and delete deployments. On my first engagement, I thought about how to clean up my database from all the failing process diagrams that I don't need any more. I asked Bernd how to get rid of the old stuff. He deleted the H2 files from his computer. That's a very fresh start. And he is now very fast in finding and installing the enterprise license key again.</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>The final camunda 7.2 release is a stone's throw away and ships a ton of new features. One of these is the typed variable value API. You may already know the plain-value-based API that exists since the process engine's very first days. A variable can be set on an execution/task/... as follows: execution.setVariable("var", 42); Behind the scenes, the process engine performs some magic to squeeze numbers, booleans, or even complex Java objects into the database and return it from there on the next call: int myLuckyNumber = (Integer) execution.getVariable("var"); With 7.2 (and the latest alpha), we introduce the typed value API.</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>With Camunda BPM 7.2.0-alpha5, we introduce Task Filters. Task filters are TaskQueries which can be saved to the database so that you can run them repeatedly. Creating a Filter using Java API At a Java API Level, a filter can be created as a regular task query: // create a taskQuery TaskQuery myTasksQuery = taskService.createTaskQuery().taskAssignee("daniel.meyer").active(); // save taskQuery as filter Filter myTasksFilter = filterService.newTaskFilter("My Tasks"); myTasksFilter.setOwner("daniel.meyer"); myTasksFilter.setQuery(myTasksQuery); String filterId = filterService.saveFilter(myTasksFilter); // execute the filter List&lt;Task&gt; tasks = filterService.listPage(filterId, 0, 20); If you want to share the filter with other users and for each user, make should return that particular user's tasks, it is possible to use Expression Language in the task query: taskService.createTaskQuery().taskAssigneeExpression("${ currentUser() }").active(); The above example uses the built-in expression currentUser() which returns the userId of the currently authenticated user (set through&nbsp;IdentityService.setAuthentication()).</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>Sometimes this topic comes up in the camunda BPM foums and I cannot stress &amp; highlight this enough! :) Writing test cases for your BPMN processes is a vital part of good process implementation. However, writing good, maintainable testcases can be cumbersome because you may have to write a lot of boilerplate code and the resulting testcases are often hard to read and understand. As a community extension,&nbsp;Martin Schimak has developed a fluent and well readable API, camunda BPM assert: Awesome, right?</div>

      </header>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>Sometimes you need to include multiple camunda BPM maven dependencies in your project. The apache maven best practice &nbsp;is to use a bom ("Bill of Materials") which ensures that you get the matching versions for multiple dependencies. For camunda bpm we prepared the camunda-bom to make sure you get the right versions for all camunda dependencies and our transitive dependencies. First, import the camunda-bom in the dependencyManagement section of your maven pom: &nbsp; &lt;dependencyManagement&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dependencies&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dependency&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;groupId&gt;org.camunda.bpm&lt;/groupId&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;artifactId&gt;camunda-bom&lt;/artifactId&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;version&gt;7.1.0-Final&lt;/version&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/dependency&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/dependencies&gt; &nbsp; &lt;/dependencyManagement&gt; Now you can reference multiple camunda dependencies without adding their &lt;version&gt;&nbsp;information: &nbsp; &lt;dependencies&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dependency&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;groupId&gt;org.camunda.bpm&lt;/groupId&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;artifactId&gt;camunda-engine&lt;/artifactId&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/dependency&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dependency&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;groupId&gt;org.camunda.bpm&lt;/groupId&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;artifactId&gt;camunda-engine-spring&lt;/artifactId&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/dependency&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...</div>

I learned a lot about community building during that time, especially in the BPM world. Now camunda takes over and will bring our network to the next level: Firstly, we want to grow our community outside the German speaking area as well, and secondly we want to explore new possibilities for discussing BPM online, that should go beyond the typical instruments we already know from general virtual communities.</div>

This refactoring has the following positive effects: write History for Boundary Events, Intermediate Catch Events following an Event Based Gateway Execution Listeners on cancel scope / concurrent activities now work proper and fixed a lot of further bugs a Receive Task with a message reference can be triggered like an ordinary event (docs) query after Historic Activity Statistics cockpit: use grunt to build client sides assets, manage client sides dependencies and fetch them (github-docs) show suspended Job Definitions on the process diagram add a view switcher to be able to write an own process definition or instance view as a plugin implement a new process definition view as a enterprise plugin to show historic process instances data performance test suite (github) enterprise support for Oracle WebLogic 12c, jBoss EAP 6.1 and 6.2 some contributions from Clint&nbsp;and Markus In total, about 90 Issues have been closed during the last two months.</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>The camunda process engine has a very active codebase and is constantly evolving. Only last week we did a major refactoring, re-implementing the way the BPMN Boundary Event, Event Subprocess, Terminate End Event and similar constructs work. In summer we introduced an activity instance model and rewrote the history implementation, turning it into a fire-and-forget event stream.&nbsp;We also constantly add new features such as incidents&nbsp;and many others. When doing such refactorings, the extensive process engine testsuite gives us the confidence that we do not break existing functionality from a functional perspective (process engine currently has 1669&nbsp;Testases, over 500 were added last year).</div>

This is a typical statement by process participants (aka business users). There are numerous possible ways to implement such a requirement in your process application, e.g. using a service task: But this is not really appropriate, since it makes the process model rather verbose and therefore less valuable for business-IT-alignment.</div>

        <div>For everyone out there using embedded task forms&nbsp;in the&nbsp;camunda tasklist&nbsp;there is great news: The forms are getting way more powerful. The upcoming alpha of camunda 7.1 introduces two extensions for embedded task forms: Client side form validation and form extensions via JavaScript. Form Validation Validation directives&nbsp;provided by&nbsp;AngularJS&nbsp;may now be attached to form fields to activate simple client-side validation constraints for them. The following form field will only accept one of the strings demo, john, mary or peter&nbsp;due to the defined pattern: &lt;input form-field type="string" name="assignee" ng-pattern="/^(demo|john|mary|peter)$/" /&gt; If a user enters an invalid value in a form field the field will be marked as invalid.</div>

Among them where camunda Modeler for editing BPMN in Eclipse, the camunda engine for executing the BPMN process and camunda-bpmn.js for rendering BPMN in JavaScript. In addition, I also did a demo of how to use camunda Cycle for automating BPMN roundtrips.</div>

        <div>If you want to do BPM / Workflow and BPMN 2.0 in PHP then we have good news for you: as part of our camunda BPM polyglot initiative we started a new incubation project which aims at providing a PHP SDK for camunda BPM. This SDK will facilitate the development of PHP-based applications that use the camunda BPM middleware services. The project will provide a client library which authenticates against the REST Api and provide PHP developers with a native API for interacting with the process engine: While the camunda BPM project stays&nbsp;focused&nbsp;on Java as primary programming language, we believe that it is important to support developers that use other programming languages and give them access to the BPMN 2.0 process engine technology, without having to rewrite that technology in every programming language.</div>

        <div>If we go on tour together with Oracle&nbsp;I think we have to have camunda BPM running on the Oracle WebLogic application server 12c (WLS in short). And one of our enterprise customers asked - so I invested a&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;and got it running (okay - to be honest - I needed quite some help from our Java EE server guru&nbsp;Christian). In this blog post I give a step by step description how run camunda BPM on WLS.</div>

        <div>High Noon in BPM City: not a soul walks the dusty main road and the sun glares mercilessly onto El Camundo and his opponent – the Oracle of the Desert. The wireless mouse still rests in his holster, his hand hovers above it – only the slightest quiver reveals Camundo's tension. Pearly beads of sweat are glistening on Oracle's face. Who will be the first to shoot off his token? This is close to what you can expect from our Shootout Roadshow, that we will run together with Oracle and Opitz Consulting (the latter as a neutral presenter).</div>

        <div>Scott Francis has written an excellent post about the core message of our presentation at bpmNEXT. He called it the "Zero Code Hypothesis".&nbsp;Though Scott's summary is completely right in its essentials, I would like to put some details straight: We don't think that "Zero Code BPM" does not work at all - Zero Coding and our approach are both reasonable, depending on what you have and what you need. The real problem is that most of the zero coding BPM vendors claim that you should use their solution for situations where you actually shouldn't.</div>

Its clear that the web itself is based on the client-server principle. Many Web frameworks like JSF, Vaadin etc. implement it like this: Provide a abstraction layer to define the HTML&nbsp;+ JS + CSS&nbsp;Code to generate (Java Code, Facelets etc.) which in the end is your application On request, generate the code sent to the browser, initially create a session model for data binding etc.</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>camunda BPM comes with a fresh REST API based on JAX-RS. Its goal is to expose the process engine services as broadly as possible. That means we aim to enable you to interact with process engine services via REST with similar expressiveness as in plain Java. With 7.0.0-alpha1, we provide methods such as task querying that already realize our desired degree of detail (similar for process definitions and instances). For future releases, we plan to broaden the scope to reach the afore-mentioned goal.</div>
