<div>
We have Camunda Cockpit as a great tool for monitoring and operations. But roles and requirements for monitoring and operations always differ in our real-life projects -&nbsp;so we allow plugins for Cockpit. In the last 48 hours (on our Camunda hackdays) we implemented a "plugin store" for the existing community plugins - so everybody can much easier try out plugins or see what plugins exist.<br />

<br />
The plugin store scans various GitHub repositories and searches for plugin metadata. And we compiled a list of all default plugins included in the standard distribution (as most of the cockpit functionality is implemented as plugin). You can browse through all plugins easily:<br />

<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;">Try it out:&nbsp;<a href="http://camunda.org/plugins/" target="_blank">http://camunda.org/plugins/</a></span></div>
<br />
After collecting plugins you can:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>download the cockpit.war: In the background this clones the GitHub repository and does a Maven build for all plugins. Then a cockpit Maven project is created which does an overlay of the original cockpit and adds all plugins as dependency. This generates the cockpit.war which then is provided as download.</li>
<li>download the pom.xml and index.html: You can download the pom.xml used to generate cockpit and build it yourself. The index.html must be included in cockpit to exclude default plugins.</li>
<li>save the configuration: You will get a unique URL to access the configuration later on - or to send it to your colleagues.</li>
</ul>

Try it out and give us feedback in <a href="http://camunda.org/community/forum.html" target="_blank">the forum</a>.</div>
