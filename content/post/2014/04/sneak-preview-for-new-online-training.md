<p>
Our tireless consulting team will publish a new online-training for camunda BPM very soon. We’ve been asked for that again and again, which is why I am more than happy that it’s finally available.
</p>
<p>
There is a little sneak preview available already: You can enjoy the first module (basically a video tutorial) for free!

And have fun!
