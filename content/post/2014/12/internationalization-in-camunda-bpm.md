<div>
In an international open source project like ours, the users speak a huge variety of languages. When building our new <a href="http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist" target="">Tasklist </a>we had to adress the question of how to deal with internationalization.<br />
<br />
<h3>
Customizing Your Own Language</h3>
In addition to the default language, we added the possibility to plugin your own language for all Tasklist texts, labels, dates and date formats. You can of course use multiple languages at a time, based on the browser settings of your users. To achieve this, you simply need to add your own language file(s) to your Tasklist, without even restarting the application.<br />

<br />
<h3>
Existing Translations</h3>
The great thing of having a community is that you get a lot of feedback and contributions. Existing translations are available as community extension, so far for German, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish and Dutch.<br />
All languages available can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/camunda/camunda-tasklist-translations" target="_blank">tasklist-translations community extension</a>.<br />
We welcome any other contribution for new languages, e.g., Spanish, Portuguese, Indian, French, Chinese, ...<br />

<h3>
Default Language</h3>
For us, the most natural language to use is English, which is spoken most by our users. That is why our Tasklist is shipped in English. We did not add any other languages to the product, since we want to focus on development rather than translation.<br />
<h4>
Limitations</h4>
As you can see, there are parts of the application which are not translated by a new language file. This refers to labels which are associated to the specific user tasks (title), processes and filters. Those entities come from the engines database or from the specific process applications which cannot be controlled by the Tasklist.<br />
The solution to this issue are language specific filters and process applications.<br />
