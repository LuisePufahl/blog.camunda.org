<br />
Last week camunda and zalando announced <a href="http://bpmn.io/">bpmn.io</a>.<br />
<br />
What is <a href="http://bpmn.io/">bpmn.io</a> about?<br />
<br />
In short: BPMN everywhere, for everyone<br />
In detail: read this <a href="http://bpmn.io/blog/posts/2014-announcing-bpmn-io.html">blogpost</a><br />
<br />
I want to explain why this is a really important step for camunda BPM.<br />
<br />
So far we are offering a great BPMN engine, probably the best you can find if you are a java developer. This engine comes with great Web Applications which fully utilize the deployed BPMN diagrams.<br />
<br />
We even offer a <a href="http://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/">BPMN modeling tool</a>, standalone and as eclipse plugin.<br />
<br />
Since BPMN is such a great modeling notation, we want more:<br />
<br />
Modeling BPMN should be easier and more convenient. There is no need to download and install software, when you can just open your browser and start modeling.<br />
<br />
If you are a developer, we want to provide you with an open framework which allows you to embed BPMN in your applications. Users will highly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
And we want all of this to be open source.<br />
<br />
We believe that this will help BPMN to spread even further.<br />
<br />
In our practical experience we have seen so many people and projects who were better off with BPMN than without it.<br />
<br />
Subscribe to the newsletter on <a href="http://bpmn.io/">bpmn.io</a> to stay up to date.<br />
<br />
And be patient until we present you with the first prototype.<br />
