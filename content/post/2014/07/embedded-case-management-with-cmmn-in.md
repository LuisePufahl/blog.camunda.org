<div>
In our latest alpha release we include a preview of the upcoming support for CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation) in camunda BPM. Time to have a look at CMMN and the way it is implemented in camunda BPM.<br />

What is CMMN?</h3>
CMMN is an emerging OMG standard for (Adaptive) Case Management. Version 1.0 is freshly released and vendor adoption starts to take off. <a href="http://www.businessprocessincubator.com/tools/case-management/cmmnwebmodeler.html">Trisotech already provides a Web-based Modeler for CMMN</a>&nbsp;and we at camunda have the ambition to provide the first <a href="http://blog.camunda.org/2014/07/open-source-embedded-case-management.html">embedded, Open Source Runtime Engine for CMMN</a>.<br />
<br />
CMMN allows modeling Cases. A case allows humans to do work in a more or less structured way in order to achieve something. Classic examples where case management is applied are Credit Application, Customer Support Management, Document Management, and so on.<br />
<br />
The following is a simple Example of a Credit Application Case modeled in CMMN:<br />

The Picture above shows the graphical representation of the CMMN Model. The model also has an executable XML representation which looks like this:

<h3>
New Features in 7.2.0-alpha3</h3>
<div>
In camunda BPM 7.2.0-alpha3 we implemented the basic Case Instance and Plan Item Instance lifecycle. On top of this, the following task types are available:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Stage</li>
<li>Human Task</li>
<li>Process Task</li>
<li>Case Task</li>
</ul>
<br />
Using API you can now start and complete cases and perform the lifecycle on the plan items:</div>
