On March 14 we merged the online community BPM-Netzwerk.de with more than 10,000 members into the new <a href="http://network.camunda.org">camunda BPM network</a>.
</p>
<p>
I personally created the first version of this community in 2004, and together with <a href="https://twitter.com/remsbach">Robert Emsbach</a> grew the community in the German speaking area. I learned a lot about community building during that time, especially in the BPM world. 
</p>
<p>
Now camunda takes over and will bring our network to the next level: Firstly, we want to grow our community outside the German speaking area as well, and secondly we want to explore new possibilities for discussing BPM online, that should go beyond the typical instruments we already know from general virtual communities. That's why we created the BPMN forum for discussing BPMN diagrams online.

It would be great if people should like this new way of discussing BPM(N) online (right now the first reactions look pretty promising), and I would like to express my gratitude to Robert for the great time we had with BPM-Netzwerk.de. He is a BPM enthusiast just like me, but way more important, he is a very good friend.
