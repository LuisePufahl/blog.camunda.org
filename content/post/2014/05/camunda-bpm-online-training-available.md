I am happy to share that our super-awesome camunda BPM Online Training is finally available.

<p>
It consists of a number of video tutorials and exercices, and also includes weekly web sessions with our experienced and remarkably good-looking consultants, where you can discuss any questions or issues you might have.

Would be great to get your feedback on this - if you think the training is a good idea, please let us know. If you think it should include another kind of learning approach or whatever else, let us know that as well.
