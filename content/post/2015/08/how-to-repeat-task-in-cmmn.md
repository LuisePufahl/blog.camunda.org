<div>
We have some good news: We implemented the repetition rule in our CMMN engine. This gives the users the ability to repeat a task under certain conditions.<br />
<br />
<b>We invite you to try it out!</b><br />
For testing purposes use the current 7.4.0-SNAPSHOT of the engine and repeat a CMMN task as often as you wish.<br />
<br />
There also exists some documentation with an explanation how the repetition rule works and how you can use it. Just read the section about&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/reference/cmmn10/markers/repetition-rule/">repetition rule</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Every feedback is welcome.</b><br />
If you miss something or something does not work as expected please let us know.<br />
<br />
PS: We are currently refactoring the documentation. So apologize if there is something in the documentation that does not work as usually. We are working on it.
