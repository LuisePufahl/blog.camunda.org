      <title>Scaling Camunda BPM in a Cluster: Job Executors and Coordination</title>
      <link>/post/2015/09/scaling-camunda-bpm-in-cluster-job/</link>

      <description>Throughout development of Camunda 7.4, one of our focus points is job executor features and improvements. The job executor is the process engine&#39;s component to perform deferred actions, such as executing an intermediate timer event or an asynchronous continuation. Thus it is central in the Camunda architecture and central for scaling the BPM platform in a cluster. In this post we provide insight in job executor behavior and how job executor instances be coordinated by employing a backoff strategy that is part of the upcoming Camunad 7.4.0-alpha2 release.

      <description>This year at the annual Camunda hackdays one team bravely took it upon themselves to balance out the innovative and useful projects with something fun and frivolous. For two days somewhere in Brandenburg we were &#34;Awesome-Team-Awesome&#34; and we turned the Camunda engine into a platform to create a D&amp;amp;D style quest game. We call it BPMN Quest. If you can&#39;t wait for it - here you can play it right away. Read more on /post/2015/09/bpmn-quest-camunda-as-game-engine/</description>

      <title>Context Help in Camunda using SOLR Search Server</title>

      <description>Last week we had our anual hack days - that means 48 hours of producing something aswesome. Together with Falko, Ingo and Thorben we build a context help within the Camunda BPM Workbench protoype. This uses Apache SOLR&amp;nbsp;to index various sources (we did the user forum, the docs on Github, a Community Extension and internal best practices). We discussed details on this index and did a comparison to ElasticSearch. It was a great study for options and use cases of such a help in our tool chain - but watch the result yourself: Context Help / Search via SOLR - hooken into Camunda BPM Workbench from camunda on Vimeo.

      <description>As part of the Hack Days this year my colleague Falko migrated an existing tool we (Camunda Consulting) used with success in a lot of projects to&amp;nbsp;bpmn.io: The Process Test Coverage Report Generator. It just hooks into an automated test (typically JUnit) and creates an HTML report showing the coverage: For every Test Case For the whole Test Suite See this example for one test case - obviously the Happy Path of the process model: The report can easily be watched locally within your IDE or hooked into your Jenkins Build.

      <title>How to repeat a task in CMMN?</title>

      <description>We have some good news: We implemented the repetition rule in our CMMN engine. This gives the users the ability to repeat a task under certain conditions. We invite you to try it out! For testing purposes use the current 7.4.0-SNAPSHOT of the engine and repeat a CMMN task as often as you wish. There also exists some documentation with an explanation how the repetition rule works and how you can use it. Read more on /post/2015/08/how-to-repeat-task-in-cmmn/</description>

      <description>If you&#39;ve ever been lucky enough to enjoy Camunda&#39;s BPMN training then you probably have fond memories of the slide featuring Compensation tasks and Cancel events. It happens to be the very last slide in the symbol set section and is traditionally follows by a well deserved break. It also happens to be a very well implemented part of the Camunda engine. This post is going to be all about how a process containing a transaction, cancel end event and compensation task are all implemented.

      <description>My colleague Ingo just finished a new cockpit plugin allowing to easily migrate a running process instance to a new version of the process definition: You can find the sources of the plugin on GitHub: https://github.com/camunda/camunda-cockpit-plugins/tree/master/cockpit-plugin-version-migration&amp;nbsp; If you want to build some migration scrips (as customers often do) you can easily cherry-pick some code from the plugin to apply it yourself, see ProcessInstanceMigrationResource.java for the core functionality). By doing so you can e.g. Read more on /post/2015/08/migrate-process-versions/</description>

      <title>Start and Complete a process with the REST API</title>

      <guid>/post/2015/08/start-and-complete-process-with-rest-api/</guid>
      <description>If you’ve already downloaded the Camunda BPM platform you’ve already got our invoice example running locally. So I’m going to start with how you might run through that process using our REST API. I’m going to assume that you’ve got some method of making those calls either programmatically or using a RestClient (I’ve used chrome’s advanced rest client&amp;nbsp;to test the calls). So lets begin...&amp;nbsp; Starting the process.&amp;nbsp; For most processes we could kick things off by using the start process instance rest call /process-definition/key/{key}/start.&amp;nbsp;But because the invoice process has a start form I’m going to use another way of starting the process /process-definition/key/{key}/submit-form [2].

      <title>Job Prioritization for Asynchronous Processing at Scale</title>

      <description>Camunda users process heavy workloads with the process engine. Often this includes asynchronous processing which is handled using the job executor component. The amount of jobs that need to be processed can quickly reach an order of magnitude of millions of jobs per day. To bring order into situations of high job executor load, Camunda BPM 7.4.0 will ship job prioritization. With our first 7.4.0-alpha1 release, you can already have a look at it and give it a try.

      <description>Are you developing HTML forms for Camunda Tasklist? Are you re-packaging your application with maven and re-deploying it to Tomcat or Wildfly for each HMTL form change? Are you annoyed by this? :) There is hope: this post explains how to setup a development environment which allows you to develop forms inside Camunda Tasklist and refresh your changes without re-packaging and re-deploying your application. We use this kind of setup ourselves when working on the Invoice Example which is provided with the Camunda Distribution.

      <title>How to clean up/purge the camunda history tables</title>

      <guid>/post/2015/07/how-to-clean-uppurge-camunda-history/</guid>
      <description>We get this question very often from customers: How can we get rid of old history data that we don&#39;t need anymore?&amp;nbsp;First it&#39;s important to ask: &#34;What do you mean by &#39;old data&#39;?&#34;. This is completely business focused and depends on the use of cockpit, who is working with the history data, how reports are generated and maybe even constraints due to legislation. One of our customers - Hamburger Sparkasse (Haspa) - built a solution that is flexible enough to address the issues raised by the questions above: They created a bunch of SQL scripts Created a parameter&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;the number of days that completed process instances should remain in the database which then&amp;nbsp;moved the old data into a set of archive tables and marked them with the time-stamp and a sequence number of the cleanup run.

      <description>No one could argue that deploying the Camunda BPM platform to a web server is unmatched in its adrenaline-inducing excitement, but we should spare a thought for those people whose aversion to scripts and consoles has meant that they have never had the opportunity to enjoy Camunda BPM deployments to their fullest. Until now... In this post I&#39;m going to explain in detail how you can deploy Camunda BPM to a server using docker and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and interestingly enough - it doesn&#39;t require so much as a glance at a console cursor.

      <title>Would you use Apache Cassandra for Camunda persistence?</title>

      <description>I am currently planning a hack session with people who are interested in using Apache Cassandra as database for Camunda Process engine. Their main motivation for supporting us is that their whole application is running on Apache Cassandra and they want to use Cassandra as persistence provider for their workflows as well. They have extensive experience with Cassandra and want to contribute their work as open source. If the hacksession which will take place at the beginning of July is successful, we would setup a public repository on GitHub were the community could collaborate around this.
