      <div class="content summary">
        <div>Or in other words: Our most awesome community day yet! Last week our annual Camunda Community Day took place. I always enjoy that day very much because it gives me the opportunity to get in touch with community contributors and users. I always learn a lot during these days and I take a lot of engergy away from it. Same as last year, the Community Day took place here at the Camunda office in exactly the same space in which we normally sit behind our desks and write code.</div>

      <div class="content summary">
        <div>I am very, very excited about this: the Camunda community now actively collaborates around providing support for Spring Boot. This is extremely cool and allows users to deploy Camunda process engine including the Rest Api and the Webapplication in Spring Boot. The project is in a very early stage, if you want to participate, join the ongoing discussion on the dev list and checkout the sources in GitHub! Many thanks to Oliver Steinhauer who provided an initial implementation that the community decided to collaborate around.</div>

        <div>Yesterday evening we met at our Partner Ancud IT in Nurremberg (Germany). Ancud presented their experiences using Portals (namely the Open Source Portal Liferay) in combination with Process Engines (namely camunda :-)). That was already a topic in a recent webinar, you can check out the recording online: English or German. Afterwards we had interessting discussions about DMN use cases and a "social collaboration hub" research project. But let's start from the beginning.</div>

        <div>Last Thursday we organized the 2nd camunda BPM community Day. After visiting Prague last year we went for the home game and invited the community to our Berlin offices. So we put all our desks and chairs and other stuff away to make room for the attendees. Around 65 people had registered and without doing an exact headcount, I suppose that more than 50 attended which Bernd described as "the biggest open source community day he ever attended".</div>

I am really impressed that we could organize that so close after the 7.0 release and so many people already traveled to Prague just for us. I can just repeat myself: AWESOME! Today I want to share some impressions and slides with you - we recorded the sessions and hope we will get videos online soon as well.</div>

        <div>Process management is not a bureaucratic evil but can be a key instrument for scalable business models. But to do so we need to get rid of our old ways of thinking. Need an example? The whole Zero Code BPM – Illusion, is one of many errors that have dominated process management in the past. On 18th March we released our BPM platform under an open source license as Business Process Management is impossible without IT (not everyone likes this, but it’s just the way it is).</div>
